INTRODUCTION
============

Minosse DSP is a Digital Signal Processor plugin for [Volumio 3](https://volumio.org/) based on [Brutefir](https://torger.se/anders/brutefir.html), a popular Open Source convolution engine by Anders Torger. The priority of Minosse DSP is to deliver the best possible sound quality along with a pleasant user experience. Generally speaking, the computer audio industry is more oriented towards versatility rather than audio quality. In the digital world, often happens that the audio signal path becomes a jungle of unidentified elaborations which unique purpose is to deliver audio output at all costs. In this context the advantages of digital signal processing might be lost along the way because of inadequate, misconfigured or poorly implemented algorithms that the user is completely unaware of.

Minosse DSP is intended to be a rock solid, no-frills, easy-to-use Digital Signal Processor. It provides a 10 band graphic equalizer and [Digital Room Correction](https://www.drc.one/), along with multichannel options for building digital x-overs. Integration with [Volumio 3](https://volumio.org/) platform is profound: volume cursor and resampler configurations are overridden to become part of Minosse itself. This is done firstly to streamline the audio signal path and secondly to make transparent to the user the best configuration choices based on the underlying hardware.
